# Student Grade Generator
The Student Grade Generator is a program that prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100. The program then outputs the correct grade based on the following scale:

A > 79
B > 60 to 79
C > 59 to 49
D > 40 to 49
E > less 40
# Speed Detector
The Speed Detector program takes as input the speed of a car in km/s. If the speed is less than 70 km/s, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".
